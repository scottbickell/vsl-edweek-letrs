Every student deserves a master reading teacher.

Teaching reading is hard work, and because many teachers lack a solid understanding of the pedagogy of reading instruction, it is even harder to achieve success. Developed by featured literacy expert Dr. Louise Moats, LETRS® (Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling) gives teachers the background and depth of knowledge to teach language and literacy skills to every student.
